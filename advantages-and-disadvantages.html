        <p>Cryptography provides several benefits such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation. However, it also has some drawbacks. Even an authorized user may find it challenging to access strongly encrypted, authenticated, and password-protected information at a time when access is vital for decision-making. High availability cannot be ensured through the use of cryptography. Other defense strategies are required to counter dangers like denial of service (DoS) attacks and total information system failure.</p>
