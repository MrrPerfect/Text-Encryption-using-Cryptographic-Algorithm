        <p>There are three main types of cryptographic algorithms:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Symmetric Key Cryptography: This type of cryptography involves the use of a single key to encrypt and decrypt data.</li>
            <li>Hash Functions: There is no usage of any key in this algorithm. A hash value with fixed length is calculated as per the plain text which makes it impossible for contents of plain text to be recovered.</li>
            <li>Asymmetric Key Cryptography: Under this system, a pair of keys is used to encrypt and decrypt information. A receiver’s public key is used for encryption and a receiver’s private key is used for decryption.</li>
