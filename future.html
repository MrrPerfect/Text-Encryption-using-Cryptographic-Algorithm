    <section>
        <p>The future of cryptography is expected to involve advances in areas like confidential computing, quantum-safe cryptography, and fully homomorphic encryption. The next stage in the development of encryption may involve the use of quantum computers, which will add layers of complexity that are currently not possible. Post-quantum cryptography aims to create encryption methods that cannot be broken by algorithms or calculations that run on future quantum computers.</p>
